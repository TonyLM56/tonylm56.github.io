					<h1>About Me</h1>
					<h2><a href="../media/MendezResumeDecember2016.pdf">Resume</a></h2>
					<img src="../images/AnthonyM.jpg">
					<p>My name is Anthony Mendez. I am currently a Freshmen in college. In High school I was enrolled in IBCP or the International Baccalaureate Career-related Programme. In order to pass the program I had to take one of two courses, Anatomy or Multimedia and web design. My Junior year I decided to take both and passed them both but in my senior year I decided to only stick with web design.</p><br>
					<p>I have always loved computers and when I heard about web design at my school I didn't want to miss the opportunity. I also wanted to take a computer science course but unfortunately it didn't fit in my schedule. Once I started the course I found out that the basics of web design are really boring but I was determined not to drop the class.</p><br>
					<p>Because of this event I am here now. I love creating websites and am always looking for a new project to get my hands on. I am not as professional as a lot of companies out there but I get the job done with the knowledge I have at hand. If you want something done that I don't know I will tell you upfront and see what I can do if you still want my help. If I don't know how to code what you want it's most likely that I will look it up and try to learn it to the best of my ability. I am one to please my customers and if for some reason I can't make a deadline I will notify you as soon as possible.</p><br>
					<p>Currently I am working part time at the Sam's Club in Franklin Wisconsin as a floor associate. The job is simple but as much as I like it, the pay isn't as great as I would like while I possess the abilities to do greater things. I am also a full time student at Milwaukee School of Engineering. Although my current major is Computer Engineering, Web design is something that has always interested me. I love learning new things and am pretty fast at picking up new skills. I'm great at working with a team but at times I will ask a lot of questions. My resume is linked to the page with all my information and a way to contact me. Thank you for your time.</p>
